TenDocGen
=========

TenDocGen is a PHP based website that compiles tenancy documents in compliance with New Zealand law.

A preview of the site is available at www.tendocgen.co.nz - it is running from a Raspberry-Pi so it slow.

Documents are compiled using Latex with the following components installed:

* texlive-common
* texlive-base
* texlive-fonts-recommended
* texlive-latex-base
* texlive-latex-extra
* texlive-latex-recommended
* latexmk

The documents themselves have been taken from: "The Complete Guide to Landlording - Copyright Australis Publishing Ltd"
and are licensed for use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand License.

The project uses a PHP based HTML library which will be made available separately in the near future.
